Most software security vulnerabilities fall into one of a small set of categories:

1. Buffer overflows.

2. Unvalidated input.

3. Race conditions.

4. Access-control problems.

5. Weaknesses in authentication, authorization or cryptographic practices.

### What is nonrepudiation?

## Variant 3

### What is computer insecurity?

Computer insecurity is the concept that a computer system is always vulnerable to attack *(and that this fact creates a constant battle between those looking to improve security and those looking to circumvent security)*.

### What does maintaining access control mean?

Maintaining access control means not only that users can access only those resources and services to which they are entitled, but also that they are not denied resources that they legitimately can expect to access.

### What is a vulnerability?

A vulnerability is a hole or a weakness in the application, which can be a design flaw or an implementation bug, that could be exploited to violate the system's security policy.


## Variant 3

### What does confidentiality of information mean?

Confidentiality means that information cannot be accessed by unauthorized parties. It is also known as secrecy.

### What is access control?
